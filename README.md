# Comprehensive Technical Documentation for Medical Imaging Segmentation Research

## Multi-modal brain aneurysm detection meets abdominal segmentation on HPC

This documentation provides comprehensive technical guidance for leveraging abdominal segmentation models for the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Challenge 2025, with specific implementation details for Texas Tech's High Performance Computing infrastructure.

## 1. RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Challenge 2025

### Competition specifications reveal unprecedented scale

The 2025 RSNA challenge represents the **first-ever multi-modal intracranial aneurysm detection competition**, launched July 29, 2025 with submissions closing October 14, 2025. The competition leverages a massive dataset of **over 6,500 imaging studies containing 3,500+ annotated aneurysms** from 18 sites across five continents, making it the most globally diverse neuroimaging challenge to date.

**Multi-modal imaging approach**: The challenge uniquely spans Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and conventional MRI sequences (T1 post-contrast and T2-weighted), focusing on "opportunistic screening" using routine brain imaging rather than dedicated aneurysm-specific scans. This approach addresses the critical clinical problem where **50% of intracranial aneurysms are only identified after rupture**, carrying mortality rates up to 50%.

**Technical requirements**: The competition uses DICOM format images with double expert annotations covering 13 distinct anatomical locations within the intracranial circulation. 3D segmentations are provided for MRI studies. Evaluation metrics likely include sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and localization accuracy measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). The competition platform is hosted on Kaggle with a **$50,000 prize pool** distributed among the top 9 competitors.

## 2. IRIS Framework Investigation Results

### First ever IRIS segmentation framework now exists for medical imaging
The IRIS framework refers to the Microsoft team which proposed the learning model and inference framework, published as [Show and Segment: Universal Medical Image Segmentation via In-Context Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Gao_Show_and_Segment_Universal_Medical_Image_Segmentation_via_In-Context_Learning_CVPR_2025_paper.html). This novel approach was used in the implementation of Spleen segmentation of abdominal scans and was trained on AMOS22 data to reach 75% DICE using minimal hardware and smaller data sets. The model is available for download in the releases section. This 13 MB file is available for download and should be placed in the checkpoints folder. https://github.com/mister-weeden/abts25 and was part of an abdominal tumor segmentation challenge in 2025, which is now the Texas Tech Team Danao. **Team Danao** performed a peer review and implemtentation of the framkeworkk which was first propossed by the Microsoft team, and are now using the [High Performance Computing Center](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/hpcc/) in Lubbock Texas which, adjacent to OpenAI Stargate(https://maps.app.goo.gl/oDcZb8pSpaqBntvz9) facility. Team Danao hopes to attain a granularity and precision never approached before, using largescale datasets and scans to tackle segmentation of human brain hemispheres, leapfrogging all other 

**Frameworks for spleen segmentation**: The medical imaging field relies on **nnU-Net** (self-configuring U-Net achieving >90% Dice scores) and **MONAI** (PyTorch-based framework with pre-trained spleen models achieving 0.961 Dice score on Medical Segmentation Decathlon). These frameworks implement 3D U-Net architectures with automatic preprocessing pipelines, patch-based training (128³-192³ patches), and combined Dice + Cross-entropy loss functions.

## 3. AMOS22 Dataset and Training Methodology

### Large-scale multi-organ segmentation benchmark

The AMOS22 (Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation) dataset encompasses **600 scans (500 CT + 100 MRI)** with voxel-level annotations for 15 abdominal organs including spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and gender-specific organs. The multi-center, multi-vendor, multi-phase dataset uses nnUNet-compatible NIfTI format with standard training/validation splits of ~400/100 cases for CT-only tasks.

**Standard training pipeline**: Implementation follows the nnUNet methodology with intensity normalization (CT: 0.5th-99.5th percentiles, MRI: Z-score), uniform voxel spacing resampling, and comprehensive augmentation strategies including elastic deformation, mirror transforms, and intensity variations. Training employs SGD optimizer (learning rate 0.01, momentum 0.99) with PolyLR scheduling over 1000 epochs, using batch size 2 due to memory constraints.

**GitHub repository context**: While the specific `github.com/mister-weeden/abts25` repository wasn't accessible, "ABTS" likely stands for "Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation" with "25" indicating 2025 version, suggesting existing work on adapting abdominal models for brain segmentation tasks.

## 4. Texas Tech HPCC Infrastructure

### RedRaider cluster provides 2.2 petaflops for deep learning

Texas Tech's HPCC offers specialized GPU partitions optimal for medical imaging: **Matador partition** (20 nodes with 40 NVIDIA GPUs, 384 GB RAM/node) and **Toreador partition** (11 nodes with 33 GPUs, 192 GB RAM/node), all connected via Mellanox HDR 100 Gbps InfiniBand. The system runs Rocky Linux with **6.9 PB Lustre filesystem** for large dataset storage.

**Deep learning environment setup**: The cluster supports MiniForge (replacing Anaconda) for Python environments, Apptainer (formerly Singularity) for containerization, and SLURM for job scheduling. GPU jobs can request up to 384 GB RAM per node with access to CUDA modules and pre-built deep learning containers. Interactive sessions enable development with Jupyter notebook support through SSH tunneling.

**Medical imaging configuration example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=matador
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
#SBATCH --mem=128G
#SBATCH --time=48:00:00
conda activate medical_imaging
python segmentation_training.py --batch_size 4 --num_workers 16
```

## 5. Adapting Abdominal Segmentation to Brain Imaging

### Three-stage cross-domain adaptation process maximizes transfer

Successfully adapting spleen segmentation models to brain aneurysm detection requires addressing fundamental domain shifts in anatomical structure (compact homogeneous spleen vs. complex heterogeneous brain), imaging characteristics (CT Hounsfield units vs. MRI intensity variations), and size distributions.

**Stage 1 - Cross-modal pre-training**: Freeze the encoder backbone from abdominal models while training new decoder heads specific to brain anatomy. This preserves learned low-level features while adapting high-level representations.

**Stage 2 - Domain-specific fine-tuning**: Selectively unfreeze deeper layers (blocks 4-6) with differential learning rates (encoder: 1e-5, decoder: 1e-3). Implement brain-specific preprocessing including skull stripping, N4 bias correction, and white-stripe normalization for MRI data.

**Stage 3 - Task optimization**: Full fine-tuning with regularization (dropout 0.2, weight decay 1e-4) using hybrid loss functions combining segmentation accuracy with domain adaptation and anatomical consistency constraints.

**Critical implementation details**: Replace CT windowing ([-160, 240] HU for abdomen) with brain-appropriate ranges ([0, 80] HU for brain tissue). Implement attention mechanisms for complex brain structures and multi-scale processing with dilated convolutions. Recent research demonstrates **5-10% Dice score improvements** when proper adaptation techniques are applied, with frameworks like SIFA achieving >70% improvement in cross-modal scenarios.

## 6. HPC Medical Imaging Technical Requirements

### GPU memory determines segmentation capabilities

**Hardware requirements scale with volume size**: 3D U-Net processing 128³ volumes requires 12-24GB GPU memory per sample, while nnU-Net needs 8-16GB depending on patch size. For production workloads, **A100 GPUs (40/80GB)** support batch sizes 2-4 for 3D volumes, with H100 (80GB) enabling batch sizes 4-8. System RAM should be **2x total GPU VRAM minimum** (1.3TB for 8x A100 setup).

**Storage and I/O optimization**: NVMe SSDs (10-50TB) for active datasets with Lustre/GPFS parallel filesystems (100TB+) for shared storage. Achieve 5-10GB/s sustained read speeds through caching strategies: MONAI's CacheDataset for small datasets, PersistentDataset for disk caching, or SmartCacheDataset for dynamic memory management.

**Memory optimization techniques**:
- **Gradient checkpointing**: Reduces memory by 50-70% through selective recomputation
- **Mixed precision (FP16/BF16)**: Cuts memory usage by ~40% with minimal accuracy loss
- **Adaptive batch sizing**: Dynamically find maximum batch size without OOM errors

**Distributed training configuration**:
```python
# Multi-node setup with proper memory management
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128,garbage_collection_threshold:0.6
model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[local_rank])
# Use synchronized batch normalization for multi-GPU consistency
model = nn.SyncBatchNorm.convert_sync_batchnorm(model)
```
