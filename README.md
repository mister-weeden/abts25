# RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Challenge

**Competition Page: [Kaggle - RSNA 2025 Intracranial Aneurysm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2025-intracranial-aneurysm-detection)**

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for the RSNA 2025 Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Challenge, hosted by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in collaboration with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS), and the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR).

### Challenge Goal
Create machine learning models to detect and precisely locate intracranial aneurysms across various types of medical images, including:
- CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography)
- MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography)
- T1 post-contrast MRI
- T2-weighted MRI

## Medical Context

Intracranial aneurysms affect approximately 3% of the global population and cause roughly 500,000 deaths annually worldwide. Up to 50% of aneurysms are only diagnosed after rupture, which can result in severe illness or death. Early detection through automated solutions could save lives by enabling timely intervention.

## Timeline

- **July 28, 2025**: Competition Start Date
- **October 7, 2025**: Entry & Team Merger Deadline
- **October 14, 2025**: Final Submission Deadline
- **October 27, 2025**: Winners' Requirement Deadline
- **November 2025**: RSNA Annual Meeting - AI Challenge Recognition Event

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC.

## Evaluation Metric

Submissions are evaluated using a **weighted multilabel Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)**:

- **Aneurysm Present** label: Weight = 13
- **Other 13 location labels**: Weight = 1 each

Final Score = Average of (Aneurysm Present score + Average of 13 location scores)

## Prize Distribution

- ðŸ¥‡ **1st Place**: $12,000
- ðŸ¥ˆ **2nd Place**: $10,000
- ðŸ¥‰ **3rd Place**: $8,000
- **4th Place**: $5,000
- **5th-9th Places**: $3,000 each

Winners will be invited to the RSNA Annual Meeting AI Challenge Recognition Event with waived fees.

## Model Development Guidelines

### Data Considerations
- Handle multi-institutional data variations
- Account for different scanner types and imaging protocols
- Implement robust preprocessing for CTA, MRA, and MRI modalities

### Key Challenges
- Class imbalance (aneurysms are rare)
- Small object detection (aneurysms can be tiny)
- Multi-modal imaging integration
- Generalization across different imaging protocols

### Recommended Approaches
- 3D CNN architectures for volumetric data
- Attention mechanisms for small object detection
- Multi-scale feature extraction
- Ensemble methods combining different modalities

## Evaluation Metrics Implementation

```python

from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

def weighted_multilabel_auc(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculate weighted multilabel AUC-ROC score.
    
    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth labels (n_samples, 14)
        y_pred: Predicted probabilities (n_samples, 14)
    
    Returns:
        Weighted average AUC-ROC score
    """
    # Calculate AUC for each label
    auc_scores = []
    for i in range(14):
        auc = roc_auc_score(y_true[:, i], y_pred[:, i])
        auc_scores.append(auc)
    
    # Apply weights (13 for aneurysm present, 1 for others)
    aneurysm_present_score = auc_scores[0] * 13
    location_scores = sum(auc_scores[1:])
    
    # Final score is average of weighted scores
    final_score = (aneurysm_present_score + location_scores) / 14
    
    return final_score
