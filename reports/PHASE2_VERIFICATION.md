  - Efficiency comparisons
  
- **Decoder Architecture Comparison**:
  - Fixed U-Net decoder
  - FPN decoder
  - Progressive decoder
  - Dense Skip decoder

## Key Features of the Test Scripts

### Comprehensive Coverage
Both scripts together provide complete coverage of Phase 2 requirements:
- Start with Phase 1 components to ensure proper foundation
- Test all Phase 2 architectural components
- Validate end-to-end functionality
- Test with realistic medical data patterns
- Compare against paper claims

### Proper Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all major test sections
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful failure handling
- Results saved to JSON files

### Realistic Medical Data Simulation
- Creates organ-like structures
- Simulates different dataset characteristics
- Tests multi-organ scenarios
- Validates cross-dataset capabilities

### Performance Metrics
- Inference time measurement
- Memory usage tracking
- Parameter counting
- Efficiency comparisons

## Test Execution

The scripts are designed to be run as:
```bash
python PHASE2_COMPLETION_VERIFICATION.py
python PHASE2_COMPLETION_VALIDATION.py
```

Both scripts will:
1. Run comprehensive tests
2. Generate detailed reports
3. Save results to timestamped JSON files
4. Return appropriate exit codes

## Expected Outcomes

### If Phase 2 is Complete:
- All architectural tests pass
- End-to-end forward pass works
- Cross-attention mechanism functional
- Memory bank operational
- Medical pattern handling verified
- Multi-organ capability confirmed

### If Phase 2 is Incomplete:
- Specific failures identified
- Detailed error messages provided
- Clear indication of what needs fixing
- Guidance for next steps

## Integration with Phase 2 TODO

These tests directly address the concerns in PHASE2_TODO.md:
1. **Decoder Channel Mismatch** - Tests verify the fixed decoder works
2. **Real Architecture Testing** - Tests use medical-like patterns
3. **Cross-Attention Validation** - Specific tests for attention mechanism
4. **Complete Integration** - End-to-end tests confirm full pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Run both test scripts in the proper Python environment
2. Analyze results to determine Phase 2 completion status
3. Update PHASE2_TODO.md based on test outcomes
4. If tests pass, consider renaming to PHASE2_COMPLETE.md
5. If tests fail, use results to guide fixes

The comprehensive nature of these tests ensures that Phase 2 completion claims can be properly verified with real confidence.
