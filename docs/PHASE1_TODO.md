# Phase 1 Implementation TODO ️

## Critical Issues Identified

** FALSE ASSUMPTION**: The previous COMPLETE.md file claimed Phase 1 was complete, but this is incorrect because:

1. **No Real Data Testing**: All tests use synthetic `torch.randn()` data instead of actual medical images
2. **No AMOS22 Integration**: Claims AMOS22 integration but only uses random tensors
3. **No Validation of Claims**: Tests don't actually validate any of the 6 paper claims
4. **Synthetic Performance Metrics**: All reported metrics (std=0.92, difference=14.75) are from random data

## What Actually Needs to be Implemented

### 1. Task Encoding Module - REAL Implementation Needed
- **Status**: Architecture exists but needs real medical data validation
- **TODO**: 
  - [ ] Test with actual AMOS22 dataset (15 anatomical structures)
  - [ ] Validate foreground path extracts meaningful features from real masks
  - [ ] Verify context path handles real 3D medical image complexity
  - [ ] Measure actual embedding quality on real anatomical structures

### 2. 3D PixelShuffle Operations - Validation Needed
- **Status**: Implementation exists but only tested on random data
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Test memory efficiency on real medical image sizes (256³, 512³)
  - [ ] Validate numerical precision with actual medical image data
  - [ ] Benchmark performance on GPU with real workloads

### 3. Real Dataset Integration Required
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Download and integrate actual AMOS22 dataset (500 CT + 100 MRI)
  - [ ] Implement proper data loading for 15 anatomical structures
  - [ ] Create real episodic sampling from different patients
  - [ ] Validate mask quality and anatomical structure coverage

## Paper Claims That Need Real Validation

### Claim 4: In-Context Learning
- **Current Status**:  Not validated - only tested with random data
- **Required**: Test that different real anatomical masks produce meaningfully different embeddings
- **TODO**: Use actual liver vs kidney vs spleen masks from AMOS22

### Claim 6: Task Embedding Reusability  
- **Current Status**:  Not validated - synthetic consistency doesn't prove reusability
- **Required**: Show same anatomical structure embedding works across different patients
- **TODO**: Test liver embedding from Patient A works for Patient B's liver segmentation

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1)
1. **Real AMOS22 Dataset Integration**
   - Download actual dataset
   - Implement proper data loading
   - Create patient-level splits

2. **Task Encoding Validation**
   - Test on real anatomical structures
   - Measure embedding quality metrics
   - Validate cross-patient consistency

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
3. **Memory and Performance Optimization**
   - Test on full-resolution medical images
   - Optimize for clinical deployment
   - Benchmark against paper specifications

## Success Criteria (Real Validation)

- [ ] Task embeddings show meaningful clustering for same anatomical structures across patients
- [ ] Different anatomical structures (liver vs kidney) produce significantly different embeddings
- [ ] Memory usage scales appropriately with medical image sizes
- [ ] Performance matches or exceeds paper claims on real data

## Current Implementation Status

**Architecture**:  Complete (pixel shuffle, task encoding, dual-path design)
**Real Data Testing**:  Not Started
**Paper Claims Validation**:  Not Started  
**AMOS22 Integration**:  Not Started

## Next Steps

1. Download real AMOS22 dataset
2. Implement proper data loading pipeline
3. Test task encoding on real anatomical structures
4. Validate paper claims with actual medical data
5. Only mark as COMPLETE when real validation passes

**Note**: Previous "completion" was based on synthetic data and doesn't validate the core hypothesis of the IRIS framework.
