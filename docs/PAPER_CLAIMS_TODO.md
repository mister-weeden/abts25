# IRIS Paper Claims Validation TODO Ô∏è

## Critical Issues Identified

** FALSE VALIDATION**: The previous "VALIDATED" file claimed all 6 paper claims were successfully validated, but this is completely incorrect because:

1. **All Tests Use Random Data**: Every single test uses `torch.randn()` synthetic data instead of real medical images
2. **No Real AMOS22 Data**: Claims AMOS22 integration but only uses fake "synthetic patients"
3. **Meaningless Metrics**: All reported Dice scores (62.0%, 84.5%, etc.) are from random tensors
4. **Cannot Actually Train**: Decoder channel mismatch prevents any real model training or validation

## The 6 Claims That Need REAL Validation

###  Claim 1: Novel Class Performance (28-69% Dice)
- **Paper Claim**: 28-69% Dice on unseen anatomical structures
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - tested on random data only
- **Real Requirement**: Test on actual held-out organs from real medical datasets
- **TODO**: 
  - [ ] Train on AMOS22 organs 1-10
  - [ ] Test on held-out organs 11-15 (pancreas, adrenals, duodenum, bladder)
  - [ ] Measure real Dice scores on actual anatomical structures

###  Claim 2: Cross-Dataset Generalization (82-86% Dice)
- **Paper Claim**: 82-86% Dice on out-of-distribution data
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - no real cross-dataset testing
- **Real Requirement**: Train on one dataset, test on completely different datasets
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Train IRIS on real AMOS22 data
  - [ ] Test on real BCV dataset (different acquisition protocols)
  - [ ] Test on real LiTS dataset (different anatomical focus)
  - [ ] Measure actual cross-dataset Dice scores

###  Claim 3: In-Distribution Performance (89.56% Dice)
- **Paper Claim**: 89.56% Dice on training distribution
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - model cannot train due to decoder issues
- **Real Requirement**: Train and test on same real dataset
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Fix decoder channel mismatch first
  - [ ] Train IRIS on real AMOS22 training set
  - [ ] Test on AMOS22 test set
  - [ ] Achieve paper's reported 89.56% Dice score

###  Claim 4: In-Context Learning (No Fine-tuning)
- **Paper Claim**: No parameter updates during inference
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - only tested with synthetic data
- **Real Requirement**: Demonstrate frozen parameters during real medical image inference
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Train model on real medical data
  - [ ] Show parameters remain frozen during inference
  - [ ] Demonstrate task embeddings guide segmentation without parameter updates
  - [ ] Test on real anatomical structures

###  Claim 5: Multi-Class Efficiency (Single Forward Pass)
- **Paper Claim**: Single forward pass for multiple organs is more efficient
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - cannot test due to architectural issues
- **Real Requirement**: Working model + real multi-organ medical images
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Fix architectural issues
  - [ ] Test single forward pass on real AMOS22 multi-organ images
  - [ ] Compare efficiency vs sequential organ segmentation
  - [ ] Measure actual speedup on real medical data

###  Claim 6: Task Embedding Reusability
- **Paper Claim**: Same embedding works across multiple queries
- **Current Status**:  INVALID - synthetic consistency doesn't prove reusability
- **Real Requirement**: Real anatomical embeddings work across different patients
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Extract liver embedding from Patient A's real CT scan
  - [ ] Use same embedding to segment Patient B's liver
  - [ ] Measure actual reusability across real patient data
  - [ ] Test across different anatomical structures

## Real Validation Requirements

### 1. Real Medical Datasets Required
- **AMOS22**: 500 CT + 100 MRI scans with 15 anatomical structures
- **BCV**: 13 abdominal organs, 30 CT scans
- **LiTS**: Liver + tumor, 131 CT scans
- **KiTS19**: Kidney + tumor, 210 CT scans
- **MSD Pancreas**: Pancreas tumor segmentation
- **Pelvic1K**: Bone segmentation

### 2. Working Model Architecture Required
- **Current Blocker**: Decoder channel mismatch prevents training
- **Required**: Fix all architectural issues first
- **Dependency**: Cannot validate any claims until model works

### 3. Proper Evaluation Metrics
- **Current**: Fake metrics from random data
- **Required**: Real Dice scores, IoU, Hausdorff distance on anatomical structures
- **Standard**: Compare against nnUNet and other medical segmentation baselines

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Priority (Immediate)
1. **Fix Architectural Issues**
   - Decoder channel mismatch
   - End-to-end training capability
   - Gradient flow validation

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
2. **Real Dataset Integration**
   - Download actual AMOS22 dataset
   - Implement proper medical image loading
   - Create real patient-level splits

3. **Model Training on Real Data**
   - Train IRIS on actual medical images
   - Validate training convergence
   - Achieve reasonable performance

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
4. **Claims Validation**
   - Test each claim systematically on real data
   - Compare against paper's reported numbers
   - Document actual performance

## Success Criteria (Real Validation)

### For Each Claim:
- [ ] Tested on real medical images (not synthetic)
- [ ] Uses actual anatomical structures from real patients
- [ ] Achieves performance within paper's reported ranges
- [ ] Compared against appropriate baselines
- [ ] Documented with proper evaluation metrics

### Overall Success:
- [ ] All 6 claims validated on real data
- [ ] Performance matches or approaches paper claims
- [ ] Model works end-to-end on real medical images
- [ ] Proper statistical significance testing

## Current Status: ALL CLAIMS INVALID

**Architecture**:  Decoder issues prevent training
**Real Data**:  No real medical datasets integrated
**Training**:  Cannot train due to architectural issues
**Validation**:  All previous validation was on synthetic data
**Claims**:  None of the 6 claims have been properly validated

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix decoder channel alignment in Phase 2
2. Download and integrate real AMOS22 dataset
3. Train model on real medical data
4. Systematically validate each claim on real anatomical structures
5. Compare against paper's reported performance
6. Only mark claims as VALIDATED when tested on real data

**IMPORTANT**: Previous validation was completely invalid. All claims need to be re-tested from scratch using real medical imaging data and a working model architecture.
