# Phase 3 Implementation TODO ⚠️

## Critical Issues Identified

**❌ FALSE ASSUMPTION**: The previous COMPLETE.md file claimed Phase 3 was complete, but this is incorrect because:

1. **Cannot Train End-to-End**: Decoder channel mismatch from Phase 2 prevents actual training
2. **Synthetic Data Only**: All testing done with fake "100 synthetic patients" instead of real AMOS22
3. **No Real Episodic Learning**: Claims episodic training works but never tested with real medical data
4. **No Loss Function Validation**: Dice + CrossEntropy losses not validated on real anatomical structures

## What Actually Needs to be Implemented

### 1. Fix Architectural Issues First - CRITICAL DEPENDENCY
- **Status**: ❌ Cannot proceed until Phase 2 decoder issues are resolved
- **Blocker**: Decoder channel mismatch prevents any real training
- **TODO**: 
  - [ ] Wait for Phase 2 decoder fix
  - [ ] Test end-to-end training capability
  - [ ] Validate gradient flow through complete model

### 2. Real AMOS22 Dataset Integration
- **Status**: ❌ Claims integration but only uses synthetic data
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Download actual AMOS22 dataset (500 CT + 100 MRI scans)
  - [ ] Implement proper DICOM/NIfTI loading
  - [ ] Create real patient-level episodic sampling
  - [ ] Validate 15 anatomical structures are properly loaded
  - [ ] Ensure reference/query pairs are from different real patients

### 3. Real Episodic Training Implementation
- **Status**: ❌ Framework exists but cannot be tested
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Test episodic training loop on real medical data
  - [ ] Validate reference-query paradigm with actual anatomical structures
  - [ ] Measure training convergence on real AMOS22 data
  - [ ] Ensure task embeddings improve over training

### 4. Loss Function Validation on Real Data
- **Status**: ❌ Only tested on random tensors
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Test Dice loss on real anatomical segmentations
  - [ ] Validate CrossEntropy loss handles real class imbalances
  - [ ] Measure loss behavior on different organ types
  - [ ] Optimize loss weighting for medical segmentation

## Paper Claims That Need Real Validation

### Claim 3: In-Distribution Performance (89.56% Dice)
- **Current Status**: ❌ Cannot test - model cannot train
- **Required**: Working architecture + real AMOS22 training
- **TODO**: Train on real data and achieve paper's reported performance

### Claim 4: In-Context Learning (No Fine-tuning)
- **Current Status**: ❌ Not validated - only synthetic testing
- **Required**: Real episodic training showing no parameter updates during inference
- **TODO**: Demonstrate frozen parameters during real medical image inference

### Claim 5: Multi-Class Efficiency
- **Current Status**: ❌ Cannot test - architecture incomplete
- **Required**: Working model + real multi-organ segmentation
- **TODO**: Show single forward pass segments multiple AMOS22 organs efficiently

## Real Dataset Requirements

### AMOS22 Dataset Integration
- **Current**: Claims "100 synthetic patients" (fake data)
- **Required**: 
  - [ ] 500 real CT scans from AMOS22
  - [ ] 100 real MRI scans from AMOS22
  - [ ] 15 anatomical structures properly labeled
  - [ ] Patient-level metadata for proper splits

### Additional Datasets for Validation
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] BCV dataset (13 abdominal organs, 30 CT scans)
  - [ ] LiTS dataset (liver + tumor, 131 CT scans)  
  - [ ] KiTS19 dataset (kidney + tumor, 210 CT scans)
  - [ ] Proper cross-dataset evaluation setup

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Priority (Blocked until Phase 2 fixed)
1. **Cannot proceed until decoder channel alignment is fixed**

### High Priority (After Phase 2 fix)
2. **Real AMOS22 Dataset Integration**
   - Download and process actual medical images
   - Implement proper data loading pipeline
   - Create real episodic sampling

3. **Real Training Pipeline Testing**
   - Test episodic training on real data
   - Validate loss functions on anatomical structures
   - Measure actual training performance

### Medium Priority (Week 2-3)
4. **Multi-Dataset Integration**
   - Add BCV, LiTS, KiTS19 datasets
   - Test cross-dataset episodic sampling
   - Validate generalization claims

## Success Criteria (Real Validation)

- [ ] Model trains end-to-end on real AMOS22 data without errors
- [ ] Episodic training converges on real anatomical structures
- [ ] Loss functions behave appropriately on medical segmentation tasks
- [ ] Training achieves reasonable Dice scores on real organs
- [ ] Reference-query paradigm works with real patient data
- [ ] Multi-dataset training improves generalization

## Current Implementation Status

**Training Infrastructure**: ✅ Framework exists, ❌ Cannot be used
**Real Data Integration**: ❌ Only synthetic data
**Loss Functions**: ✅ Implementation exists, ❌ Real validation needed
**Episodic Learning**: ❌ Cannot test due to architectural issues
**Multi-Dataset Support**: ❌ No real datasets integrated

## Blockers and Dependencies

1. **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Phase 2 decoder channel mismatch must be fixed first
2. **DATA DEPENDENCY**: Need to download real AMOS22 dataset
3. **VALIDATION DEPENDENCY**: Need working end-to-end model

## Next Steps

1. **WAIT**: Cannot proceed until Phase 2 architectural issues are resolved
2. Download real AMOS22 dataset while waiting
3. Once Phase 2 is fixed, test training pipeline on real data
4. Validate all training components with actual medical images
5. Only mark as COMPLETE when training works on real AMOS22 data

**Note**: Previous "completion" was premature - the training pipeline cannot actually be used due to architectural issues and lack of real data.
