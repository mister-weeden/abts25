# Phase 2 Implementation TODO Ô∏è

## Critical Issues Identified

** FALSE ASSUMPTION**: The previous COMPLETE.md file claimed Phase 2 was complete, but this is incorrect because:

1. **Decoder Channel Mismatch**: Acknowledged but not fixed - prevents end-to-end training
2. **No Real Architecture Testing**: Only tested with synthetic random tensors
3. **No Cross-Attention Validation**: Claims cross-attention works but never tested with real medical features
4. **No Multi-Scale Validation**: Multi-scale features not validated on real medical images

## What Actually Needs to be Implemented

### 1. Fix Decoder Channel Alignment - CRITICAL
- **Status**:  Known issue preventing end-to-end training
- **TODO**: 
  - [ ] Debug and fix skip connection channel dimensions
  - [ ] Ensure encoder-decoder channel compatibility
  - [ ] Test full forward pass without errors
  - [ ] Validate gradient flow through complete model

### 2. Real Medical Image Architecture Testing
- **Status**:  Only tested on random data
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Test 3D UNet encoder on real AMOS22 CT/MRI data
  - [ ] Validate multi-scale feature extraction on anatomical structures
  - [ ] Test query-based decoder with real task embeddings
  - [ ] Measure actual memory usage on medical image sizes

### 3. Cross-Attention Mechanism Validation
- **Status**:  Not validated with real data
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Test cross-attention between real anatomical task embeddings and query features
  - [ ] Validate attention maps focus on relevant anatomical regions
  - [ ] Measure attention quality on different organ types
  - [ ] Ensure task guidance actually improves segmentation

### 4. Complete IRIS Model Integration
- **Status**:  Cannot train end-to-end due to decoder issues
- **TODO**:
  - [ ] Fix all architectural issues
  - [ ] Test complete model on real AMOS22 data
  - [ ] Validate two-stage inference (encode task once, use multiple times)
  - [ ] Test memory bank functionality with real embeddings

## Paper Claims That Need Real Validation

### Claim 1: Novel Class Performance (28-69% Dice)
- **Current Status**:  Cannot test - model doesn't work end-to-end
- **Required**: Fix decoder, test on real unseen anatomical structures
- **TODO**: Test on held-out organs from AMOS22

### Claim 2: Cross-Dataset Generalization (82-86% Dice)
- **Current Status**:  Cannot test - architecture incomplete
- **Required**: Working model + multiple real datasets
- **TODO**: Test AMOS22-trained model on BCV, LiTS, KiTS19

### Claim 3: In-Distribution Performance (89.56% Dice)
- **Current Status**:  Cannot test - model cannot train
- **Required**: Fix decoder + train on real AMOS22 data
- **TODO**: Achieve paper's reported performance on training data

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Priority (Immediate)
1. **Fix Decoder Channel Mismatch**
   - Debug skip connection dimensions
   - Ensure encoder-decoder compatibility
   - Test end-to-end forward pass

### High Priority (Week 1)
2. **Real Data Architecture Testing**
   - Test on actual AMOS22 medical images
   - Validate multi-scale processing
   - Measure real memory requirements

3. **Cross-Attention Validation**
   - Test with real anatomical embeddings
   - Validate attention quality
   - Ensure task guidance works

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
4. **Complete Model Integration**
   - End-to-end training capability
   - Two-stage inference testing
   - Memory bank validation

## Success Criteria (Real Validation)

- [ ] Complete model trains end-to-end without errors
- [ ] Multi-scale features capture real anatomical details
- [ ] Cross-attention focuses on relevant anatomical regions
- [ ] Two-stage inference works with real task embeddings
- [ ] Memory usage is practical for clinical deployment
- [ ] Performance approaches paper claims on real data

## Current Implementation Status

**3D UNet Encoder**:  Architecture complete,  Real data testing needed
**Query-Based Decoder**:  Channel mismatch prevents use
**Cross-Attention**:  Implementation exists,  Real validation needed
**Complete Integration**:  Cannot work due to decoder issues
**Real Data Testing**:  Not started

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix decoder channel alignment issue
2. Test complete architecture on real AMOS22 data
3. Validate cross-attention with real anatomical embeddings
4. Measure actual performance on medical images
5. Only mark as COMPLETE when model trains end-to-end on real data

**Note**: Previous "completion" was misleading - the model cannot actually be used for training due to architectural issues.
