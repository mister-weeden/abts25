Place the BCV dataset images and labels here after download.
Recommended structure:
- imagesTr/ (for training images)
- labelsTr/ (for training labels)
- imagesTs/ (for test images, if available)
- labelsTs/ (for test labels, if available)

Example:
  src/data/bcv/imagesTr/
  src/data/bcv/labelsTr/

File names should match between images and labels for each case.
